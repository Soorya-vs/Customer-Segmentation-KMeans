# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using K-Means

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers of a shopping mall based on behavior metrics such as **Age**, **Income**, **Spending**, and **Frequency**. It helps businesses target specific customer groups for marketing and offers.

## 📌 Objective
Group customers into meaningful segments using unsupervised learning, aiding in strategic decision-making for personalized marketing.

## 🔍 Dataset
- `Shopping mall.csv`  
- Features: Age, Gender, Income, Spending Score, Frequency

## ⚙️ Techniques Used
- Data Preprocessing & Scaling
- Elbow Method to Determine Optimal Clusters
- K-Means Clustering
- Silhouette Score Evaluation
- 2D & 3D Cluster Visualization

## 📊 Key Output
- 4 distinct customer segments
- Visual insights via 2D pair plots and animated 3D scatter plot
- Exported annotated CSV: `Customer_Segments_Annotated.csv`

## 📈 Silhouette Score
Silhouette Score: 0.255 (Moderate clustering performance)

## 📂 Files Included
- `Customer Segmentation.ipynb` – Full analysis notebook
- `Customer Segments.csv` – Final data with cluster labels
- `README.md` – Project summary
- `3D_Cluster_Animation.gif` – Animated 3D visualization (optional)
